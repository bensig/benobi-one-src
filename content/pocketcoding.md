## Automate yourself

You have expertise. You have workflows. You have things you do over and over. Now you can build AI tools that work like you do—and run while you sleep.

## What is Pocket Coding?

Pocket Coding is a workshop where you build AI tools for your actual work. You leave with something real—an automation, an app, a workflow you'll actually use.

We've taught CPAs to extract data from messy tax documents. Lawyers to parse discovery files and find key evidence. Coaches to build adaptive training systems. Content creators to automate outreach.

Whatever you do, there's a version of it that AI can handle. We'll help you build it.

## What You'll Learn

- **Plan before you build** — How to think like a developer and spec out what you actually need
- **Use the right tools** — Claude, Cursor, local models, browser automation—when to use what
- **Extract data from messy documents** — PDFs, forms, scanned files
- **Keep sensitive data private** — Run models locally when you can't send client info to the cloud
- **Build agents that work like you** — Automate decisions, not just tasks
- **Ship real projects** — Apps, automations, workflows that actually work

---

## Who This Is For

- **Professionals with repetitive knowledge work** — Accountants, lawyers, consultants, analysts
- **Founders and creators** — Who want to build tools without hiring a dev team
- **Anyone drowning in documents** — PDFs, forms, spreadsheets, emails
- **People who need to keep data private** — Client confidentiality, health data, financial info

You don't need to know how to code. You need to know what you want to build.

---

## The Workshop

- 10 weekly group calls, 1 hour each
- 2 x 30-min 1-on-1 calls included
- Async support from our team between calls
- You bring real problems—we solve them together

**You'll walk away with:**

- **Something useful now** — A tool that solves a problem you have today
- **A bigger picture** — What else you could build
- **A working prototype** — Something you actually need, not a demo
