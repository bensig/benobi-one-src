## Build products from your phone using AI agents.

In 12 months, I shipped a bestselling book, native mobile apps, a Bitcoin hedge fund portal, a multisig wallet, an AI prediction market, and an operating system with 10 custom fine-tuned models.

I didn't write a single line of code the traditional way.

I used AI agents, SSH from my phone, and a workflow I call pocket coding.

**Now I'm teaching it.**
