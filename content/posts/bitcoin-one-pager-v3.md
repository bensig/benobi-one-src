## The Problem: No Great Starting Point

I've been thinking about this for a while - there's really no great resource that I'm aware of for sending someone who is trying to get into Bitcoin or knows nothing about it. You know the conversation: a friend says "I still don't understand it, man. I've been friends with you for years and I still don't get Bitcoin."

I wanted to create something better.

## Version 3: Simpler and Deeper

I updated the Bitcoin one pager to include additional information while making it simpler in some ways. **Page one is now even more accessible**, while **page two goes more in-depth** with concepts that really matter.

## The Difficulty Adjustment: The Key to Understanding Bitcoin's Value

One of the most important additions to version 3 is an explanation of the difficulty adjustment and how mining works. I read somewhere that there's no crossover between people who can't explain the difficulty adjustment and people who don't see value in Bitcoin.

In other words: if someone doesn't see value in Bitcoin, they usually cannot explain how the difficulty adjustment works.

This really makes sense - it's not the simplest concept, but it's also not that hard to understand. It's absolutely fundamental to why Bitcoin works. So I wanted to attempt making this concept accessible in the Bitcoin one pager.

## Lessons from Writing Bitcoin 1 Million

Creating this new version, I incorporated knowledge and experience from writing the [Bitcoin 1 Million book](https://amzn.to/3Xze3ja). These insights helped me distill complex ideas into clear, digestible explanations that work for complete beginners.

## The Car Wash Inspiration

My goal with this? I actually want to sell these as physical sheets at my local car wash in Santa Monica. That's what inspired version one - I can work from there while my car is being washed (it's also walking distance to the office, but that's beside the point).

The car wash is where I even updated it to version two. There's something about making a resource that works in the real world - something you can hand to someone or leave on a counter.

## Introducing BitcoinOnePager.com

I've created a new site: **[bitcoinonepager.com](https://bitcoinonepager.com)**

It's got:
- The latest version 3 PDF available for **free download**
- High-quality **laminated prints** you can order
- Great information and links to continue learning

Visit [bitcoinonepager.com](https://bitcoinonepager.com) to:

I hope this becomes a great resource for people to start their Bitcoin journey in a clear, accessible way. If you've been looking for something to share with friends, family, or curious newcomers - this is it.
