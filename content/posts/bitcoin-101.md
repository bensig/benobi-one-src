## Why I Created This Guide

After years of explaining Bitcoin to curious friends and family members, I noticed many of the same questions and misconceptions coming up repeatedly. I wanted to create a simple, non-technical resource that addresses these common points and provides a solid foundation for understanding Bitcoin.

## Using This Guide

Feel free to:
- Download and share this PDF with anyone interested in learning about Bitcoin
- Print copies for meetups or educational events
- Link to this page from your own resources

The guide is intentionally kept to one page to avoid overwhelming newcomers while providing enough information to spark interest and understanding. I also kept it high contrast and easy to read - so it can be printed on a single sheet of paper on any printer.

## Additional Resources

For those wanting to learn more after reading the guide, I recommend checking out my [Bitcoin Resources](/resources) page for carefully curated learning materials.

## Feedback Welcome
