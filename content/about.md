## AI + Product Development

In 2025, I went deep on AI-assisted development — what my friends call "pocket coding." Using Claude, Cursor, and local fine-tuned models, I shipped multiple products from my phone without writing traditional code. This includes:

- A bestselling book co-written with AI assistance
- Native iOS, Android, and Apple Watch apps
- A Bitcoin multisig wallet with PSBT support
- An AI platform running 10 custom fine-tuned models
- Investor portals, prediction markets, and more

I'm now teaching this workflow to others through [Pocket Coding](/pocketcoding) — a workshop for founders and creators who want to build products without a traditional engineering background.
